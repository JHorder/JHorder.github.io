# About Me

I am a bioinformatician and computational biologist with expertise in analyzing complex biological datasets, developing computational tools, and applying machine learning to solve biological problems.

My work focuses on [your specific research areas, e.g., genomics, transcriptomics, structural biology, etc.], where I combine statistical analysis, programming, and biological knowledge to uncover meaningful patterns in biological data.

I am passionate about open science, reproducible research, and creating tools that make bioinformatics more accessible to the broader scientific community.
